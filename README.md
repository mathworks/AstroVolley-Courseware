AstroVolley is free courseware authored by MathWorks&reg; to help teach students the basics of plotting and app building with MATLAB&reg;. During this course students will create their own astrodynamics game where navigators attempt to deliver payloads between star cruisers by volleying them through fantastical gravity fields.
